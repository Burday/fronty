# Fronty

This is my personal frontpage, Fronty. It has a search function, that searches DuckDuckGo and a few bookmarked sites. There are also two ways to customize it without editing the code, by disabling/enabling the dark mode and disabling/enabling the greeting at the top.

### Installing the dependencies

`npm i`

This will install all dependencies needed to run this site.

### Installing the Chrome add-on

By default, it isn't possible to have one important feature of this front page, which is automatically highlighting the URL bar when you enter it. To fix this, I made a chrome add-on which you can download [here](https://github.com/Burday/Fronty-URL-Focuser). More information on how to do it is in the repository.

### Running

To run the site, simply navigate to the folder and run

`npm start`

### Customizing

If you want to customize this, you can change the colors in redux/differentThemes.js and change the colors to your liking.
You can also customize the bookmarked sites in Home/Websites.js.

You can also customize this site and it's code in any way you like.

## Online version

You can try to online build on https://fronty-page.netlify.app/ but it's highly customized to me.
