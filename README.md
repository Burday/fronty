# Fronty

This is my personal frontpage, Fronty. It has a search function, that searches DuckDuckGo and a few bookmarked sites. There are also two ways to customize it without editing the code, by disabling/enabling the dark mode and disabling/enabling the greeting at the top.

### Installing the dependencies

`npm i`

This will install all dependencies needed to run this site.

### Running

To run the site, simply navigate to the folder and run

`npm start`

### Customizing

If you want to customize this, you can change the colors in redux/differentThemes.js and change the colors to your liking.
You can also customize the bookmarked sites in Home/Websites.js.

You can also customize this site and it's code in any way you like.
